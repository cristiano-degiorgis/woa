After installing Mavericks, you need to reinstall the XCode Command Line Tools. 
This will bring back the /usr/include/apache2 directory. 
You do this by updating your XCode and then run xcode-select --install.

You can download pkg-config here.(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)

MacPorts helps a lot to install command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the Mac OS X operating system.

You can download MacPorts here. 
After installing MacPorts unarchive the pkg-config file, open a terminal, switch to the folder and type the following command:	
    sudo port install pkgconfig

I am a novice with mono but followed some instructions. I downloaded and installed everything from here: http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html

To get Apache to work with mod_mono.so I downloaded source from this page: http://download.mono-project.com/sources/mod_mono/

You have to compile it. I went into the unpacked directory and wrote this in termminal:

./configure --prefix=/usr          ***
make
sudo make install

This puts the mod_mono.so in correct Apache dir and the mod_mono.conf file. To include it you must add this to your httpd.conf (I put it at the end of the file):

 # mod_mono_configuration                                                  
 Include /etc/apache2/mod_mono.conf
 MonoServerPath /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/mod-mono-server4 (mod-mono-server o mod-mono-server2 non va....)
 
 ---- httpd.conf ------
 
 # mod_mono_configuration                                                  
Include /etc/apache2/mod_mono.conf
#The configuration defaults to running the 1.0 runtime for applications, 
#if you want to use the 2.0 runtime, you can just use the MonoServerPath directive to point to the 2.0 server, like this:
#MonoServerPath /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/mod-mono-server
MonoServerPath /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/mod-mono-server4

----------- stackoverflow
I'm trying to figure if it's possible to run as is an old asp.net 1.1 app using an mdb file as storage under mac/mono.

I finally configured OSX(Yosemite)+apache2+mono(mod_mono) to have my app running under mac. Now the app shows up, but it does not connect to the db
current conn string: 

    <add key="strConn" value="Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=/FilePAth/MyAccessFile.mdb" /> 

After some reeding seems there's no way to have it run on mac: the only option should run only on linux: http://www.mono-project.com/archived/ole_db/

If so, how do you suggest to proceed? Is there any alternative rather than migrate the access db to a supported mac storage such as mysql?

I do not have a lot of experience under OSX, in case I have to migrate it, what db do you suggest to use in order to:

-  work smoothly under mac+mono

-  easy porting from current ms access db

Any tips are more then welcome!
